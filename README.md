# runtimeatlas

## Overview

**runtimeatlas** is a personal knowledge hub containing curated notes, rewritten concepts, and indexes developed through formal training and independent study across multiple cybersecurity disciplines.

The repository emphasizes understanding *how systems and software behave in practice* rather than documenting lab walkthroughs or procedural instructions.

---

## Scope and Intent

This repository is intended to:

- Capture **conceptual understanding**, not lab walkthroughs  
- Emphasize **execution-time behavior** over static configuration  
- Provide **indexes and synthesis** across domains  
- Serve as a long-term **professional and research-oriented reference**

It is **not** intended to:

- Reproduce proprietary course materials  
- Publish step-by-step exploitation guides  
- Share environment-specific commands, binaries, or answers  

All content is written in original language and generalized beyond specific training environments.

---

## Domains Represented

Content in this repository draws from and connects work across:

- Incident response  
- Network and memory forensics  
- Reverse engineering  
- Binary exploitation and offensive foundations  

These domains are presented as complementary perspectives rather than isolated skill areas.

---

## Organization

The repository is organized primarily by certification context for clarity, with shared indexes used to connect concepts across domains.
