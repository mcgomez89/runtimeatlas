# GXPN

This directory contains conceptual notes, rewritten summaries, and indexes derived from study and practice associated with the GIAC Exploit Researcher and Advanced Penetration Tester (GXPN) curriculum.

Content emphasizes exploitation primitives, mitigation concepts, and execution behavior at a generalized level. No proprietary lab materials or step-by-step exploitation guides are included.

The material here is intended for conceptual understanding and long-term reference.
